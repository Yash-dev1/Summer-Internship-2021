# Summer-Internship-2021

Initially, I learned about the BPSK signal transmission and reception
methods. The analysis of transmitters and receivers for the BPSK signal
transmission and reception was then done using MATLAB coding. Various
models for the transmitters and receivers were generated using MATLAB that
included noise, fading, and other aspects of signal processing. This helped in
developing real-time data that might be possible during hardware simulation.
The data generated through the simulation is entered in Deep Neural Networks
to replace the receivers' conventional methods. The Neural Networks were
designed in Python, which encouraged me to learn advanced coding and
provided me an understanding of how neural networks work using multiple
python libraries like Numpy, Pandas, and SKLearn. The numerous hidden
layers used in the network helped with the non-linear transformations of the
inputs entered into the network, ultimately classifying it into bits 0 and 1. The
use of DNN on the generated data gave accurate results for predicting the bits
received by the receiver. Hence, the conclusions drawn from the results were
that through machine learning, the standard techniques of reception could be
changed, and consequently, the signal processing can be learned through the use
of simple DNNs. Also, these techniques can also be implemented on the
hardware simulation part.
